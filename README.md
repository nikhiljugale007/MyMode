# MyMode
When we are not receving someones phone call, it is unclear to the caller the reson why er are not reeving the call.
MyMode solves this problems.
MyMode provides different modes like study mode, sports mode, movie mode and many more.
You can also add more custom modes.
If you select a mode and start it then when a call comes it rejects the call and send user a custom message like "I am in lecture, I will call you later" which you can customize.
It also allows you to select if a call comes more than 2 time then allow it to ring instead of rejecting.
